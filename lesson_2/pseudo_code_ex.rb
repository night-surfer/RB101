#a method that returns the sum of two integers

#a method that takes an array of integers, 
#and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, 
#starting with the first element.

#make a method that adds two numbers 
casual
get input of two integers 
add the input
print the result

#a method that takes an array of strings, 
#and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

casual 
transform an array of strings into a sentence

formal 
START 
perform method on array to flatten each string into one long string
create new array with outcome
print new array 
END 

merge 
merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) # => [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]

START 
iterate over both arrays
append 1st index from each array into new array 
then do the same for the rest of the two arrays 
print new array
